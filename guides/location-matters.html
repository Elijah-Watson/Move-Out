					<p>When moving out, an important consideration is where you are moving. Perhaps you already know
						exactly where you want to
						go, or maybe you havenâ€™t quite decided yet. Regardless, putting some thought into what all the
						location you are moving
						to affects will help you to make better decisions and get a better idea of what your future
						expenses might be.</p>
					<p><b>Housing.</b> If you choose to live in a rural or suburban area, the most reasonable housing
						may be a rental home, duplex, or
						trailer whereas an apartment might make more since in the city. Additionally, the cost of
						housing can vary wildly
						depending on the city or state. For example, housing in New York City can easily be double or
						triple a comparable option
						in other cities.</p>
					<p><b>Transportation.</b> Depending on the area you live, good public transportation may or may not
						be available. If it is, you
						must weigh the pros and cons of each form of transportation (specifically cost and convenience)
						and decide which option
						fits your circumstance the best. If it is not, a vehicle will almost definitely be a necessity.
					</p>
					<p><b>Taxes.</b> Taxes are something that few people fully understand. Even with tools to help, it
						can be a headache to deal with
						and a cause for anxiety. However, it is worth looking into the taxes you may face in an area you
						are considering moving
						to because they can make a significant impact on your finances. The three main categories that
						taxes fall into are taxes
						on income, taxes on property, and taxes on goods and services. The implementations and amounts
						can vary wildly. For
						example, Tennessee has a low property tax, high sales tax, and no income tax while Oregon has a
						moderate property tax,
						high income tax, and no sales tax.</p>
					<p><b>Cost of living.</b> The average cost of items in general can vary between areas. Things such
						as gasoline, groceries,
						internet, utilities, and more can all change based on location. For example, the cost of
						groceries in New York City can
						be up to 30% higher than other cities.</p>
					<p>Location definitely plays a major role in what your budget will look like after you move. It is
						important to consider
						these factors whether you are still choosing a location or trying to create a financial plan. By
						taking the time to
						research these things, however, you will set yourself up for success as you make your move.</p>
