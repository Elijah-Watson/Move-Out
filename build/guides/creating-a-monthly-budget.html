In order to create one, it is important to have an idea of what your monthly expenses are and/or will be. If you are moving out, you may not know what to expect. This guide breaks down some of the most important things to have in any budget.</p><p>Before we dig into what should be in your budget, it is important to address how much those things will cost. Unfortunately, this guide will not end in a magic number that tells you how much your need each month. That is not how a budget works. Instead, you have to look at things like <a href=location-matters.html>where you are moving</a>, how you plan to live, and how much you plan to make and then tailor your cost estimates to you unique circumstance.</p><p>It is also important to note that how you plan to style your budget is also up to you. Some people prefer general categories such as “Food,” while others prefer more specific items such as “Groceries,” “Fast Food,” and “Fine Dining.” You must consider what would be most accurate and most helpful to you.</p><p><b>Housing.</b> This should include your mortgage or rent. Property tax should also be considered if it applies in your area and it is not already included in the rent.</p><p><b>Utilities.</b> Depending on the exact type of housing you choose, you may have to include some or all of the following things in your budget: electric, natural gas, water, waste disposal, internet, etc. Another critical “utility” that probably deserves its own spot on your budget is the phone bill.</p><p><b>Insurance.</b> Depending on your housing arrangement, you may need either homeowners insurance or renters insurance. If you own any kind of vehicle, you will need auto insurance. Unless it is provided by your employer, you will also need health insurance. Depending on you circumstances, life insurance might also be a consideration.</p><p><b>Loans.</b> Any outstanding debt that requires monthly payments needs to be included. This can include car payments, student loans, or credit card debt.</p><p><b>Transportation.</b> If you plan to make use of a cities public transportation system, you may need to budget money for fare or a monthly pass. If you plan on driving your own vehicle, you will need to include the cost of gasoline (or electricity), maintenance, and yearly fees.</p><p><b>Food.</b> This includes groceries, fast food, and eating at sit-down restaurants. Clothing. This category should include around-the-house clothing, street wear, formal wear, shoes, jewelry, and other accessories.</p><p><b>Personal Care.</b> Things such as toothpaste, deodorant, soap, shampoo, etc. fall into this category. Some may choose to group these items with groceries, while others prefer to list them separately.</p><p><b>Household items.</b> This category is a sort of catchall for things you may need to buy for your living space. Small things like trash bags, air filters, and cleaning supplies as well as big things like furniture, kitchenware, and appliances belong here.</p><p><b>Entertainment.</b> Perhaps the most exciting category on any budget, it can also be the most difficult to stick too. Entertainment can include activities such as going to the movies or a concert, media such as streaming services and video games, vacations, hobbies, and just about anything else that you do for fun.</p><p><b>Savings.</b> Perhaps the most neglected category on any budget; it can be one of the most crucial to your success. There are many different types of savings to account for. Perhaps the most important is an emergency fund. If something unexpected happens (injury, car accident, etc.), and you do not have any spare funds, your budget can quickly fall apart. By putting aside just a small portion of your income each month, you can help to negate the impact of such unexpected events. Another important type of savings is retirement savings. The earlier you start saving for your retirement, the less you will have to put aside each month. In addition to these savings, it is also good to have a general savings account. This can be used to pay for big, one-time purchases such as a new car, a big trip, a new TV, etc. Or, more practically, it can be used to help you pay off loans early to avoid unnecessary interest.</p><p><b>Other.</b> Depending on your circumstances, there may be other things that need to be included into your budget such as child care, regular medical expenses, career specific items, etc. Take time to think through what expenses may be specific to you and include those in your budget as well.s</p><p>When preparing a budget, there certainly is a lot to think about. Don’t be overwhelmed. With careful planning and dedicated effort, you can create an effective system for managing your finances every month. Not only will this give you a better idea of what to expect, but budgeting is also certain to improve your financial health and increase your peace of mind.</p></div></div></article></div><script type=text/javascript src=../guide.f436a71f88d97b0a1b1e.js></script></body></html>
