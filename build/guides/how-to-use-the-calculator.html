There are three main “phases” of moving out that the calculator focuses on: life before moving, saving up, and life after moving. This guide will break down each phase in reverse order (this will make sense as you read on).</p><p><b>Life after moving.</b> The sections “Future Job” and “Future Monthly Expenses” relate to this phase. “Future Monthly Expenses” is fairly straightforward: just <a href=creating-a-monthly-budget.html>create a monthly budget</a> for when you move out. The “Future Job” section is where you input your estimated income after your move. Depending on the type of work you expect to do, different input options might make sense. Not sure what to put here? Don’t worry. Just put your best guess; you can always come back to it later.</p><p><b>Saving up.</b> An important part of saving up for anything is having a goal to reach. In order to do that, use the section “One Time Expenses” to add everything that will be necessary in order to move successfully. This should include any potential <a href=calculating-move-expenses.html>moving expenses</a>. Additionally, it should include any necessary fees or deposits relating to your future housing choice. For example, many apartments or rental will require application fees, first and last months’ rent, a security deposit, and/or other fees. It may also be a good idea to set aside some funds for sprucing up and furnishing your new living space. Another important thing to include is enough money to cover at least one month’s living expenses. (Tip: You can see how much one month of living expenses is by checking the “Monthly Expenses” box in the final section.) This is technically optional, but it can be very helpful covering expenses before your first paycheck, and even if you don’t end up needing it, it will be a good emergency fund. Finally, you will definitely want to have an emergency fund. There is no set amount that makes sense, but the more you have in it, the more prepared you will be for when a disaster strikes. Ideally, an emergency fund should be large enough to cover several months’ worth of living expenses.</p><p><b>Life before moving.</b> The sections “Current Job” and “Current Monthly Expenses” relate to this phase. “Current Monthly Expenses” is similar to “Future Monthly Expenses”: enter what your typical expenses are each month. You can either list each individual category like a budget, or simply enter one value if you already know your monthly expenses total. The “Current Job” section is where you input your current income. Depending on the type of work you expect to do, different input options might make sense. For example, if you work multiple jobs or regular overtime, the “Hourly Wage / Hours” options might not be the best choice.</p><p><b>Finances and debts.</b> The sections “Finances” and “Debts” are closely related to the “life before moving” phase. In the “Finances” section, simply input what money you currently have saved up. This will be used to calculate how close you are to your savings target. In the “Debts” section, include any outstanding debts that need to be payed before the move. (Note: This is intended for short-term debts such as monthly credit card debt. For long-term debts such as a car loan, it might make more sense to list the monthly payment under “Current Monthly Expenses.”)</p><p><b>Personal info.</b> This section is self-exclamatory. Simply enter your marital status, where you live now, and where you want to live. This information is used to get tax data. This calculator handles all sales and income tax calculations for your so you. Therefore, any values entered should be pre-tax values.</p><p>Once you have mostly or entirely filled out the guide, you should see values in the boxes of the final section. These are the calculated results. Each box contains helpful information, but the following three boxes contain the most important information. The box labeled either “Deficit” or “Surplus” will tell you how much you more money you need to move out or how much extra you have. The “Move Out Date” box is an estimate of when you will reach your calculated moving cost goal based on your current income and expenses. The box labeled either “Monthly Deficit” or “Monthly Surplus” is an estimate of how far over or under budget you will be each month after you have moved out.</p><p>Ideally, you will want to have a surplus of moving funds and a projected future monthly surplus. If you don’t, don’t worry. That is the point of the calculator. It is meant to help you come up with a plan. If you want to bring your move out date closer, go back to the earlier part of the guide. Tweak the “Current Job” values if you can work more. Tweak the “Current Monthly Expenses” or “One Time Expenses” if you think there are expenses listed there that are unnecessary. If you need to turn your future monthly deficit into a future monthly surplus, go back to the later part of the guide. Again, either tweak the “Future Job” values if you are willing to work more or trim down your “Future Monthly Expenses” budget. One important thing to remember to while doing this is not to simply change the numbers until they work. Make sure your plan is reasonable. It is better to know your plan falls a bit short and prepare for it than to think you are prepared and find out otherwise later.</p></div></div></article></div><script type=text/javascript src=../guide.f436a71f88d97b0a1b1e.js></script></body></html>
